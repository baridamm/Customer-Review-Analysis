# Customer-Review-Analysis
Relationship between sales and customer reviews 

In this project, our goal is to find the relationship between online reviews and product sales in online stores. For this purpose, data was gathered from Amazon store, and a new dataset was established with online reviews and sales rank.

  After making sure that the data is clean, we build our multivariable regression model and explore the relationship between star ratings and number of reviews with product sales. For this purpose, we use four different datasets containing data from musical instruments, appliances, video games and food.
  
  The results vary for different categories. For all the categories there is no considerable relationship between star rating and product sales. However, if we only look at the products with higher number of reviews the positive relationship between star ratings and product sales increases.
  
  Regarding number of reviews, for musical instruments and video games there is a considerable positive relationship between number of reviews and product sales. If we only look at products with higher number of ratings, the positive relationship is considerable for all the categories.
